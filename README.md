# Website v4
A website created with magic, and everything I've learned over the past 6 years of web design and development. With so many things working under the hood, it's no joke that this site took me over a year to design -- and the build still isn't finished. I'll be working on this incrementally throughout the coming months as one of my side projects.

# What does this have?
- Tailwind CSS (no more going through the installation guide!) - for styling components easily
- `swr` (@vercel) - for fetching constantly mutating data
  - `fetcher.js` so you don't have to keep writing return functions
- `react-icons` - for including your favorite icon packs without increasing bundle size significantly. Tree shaking included.
- `react-wrap-balancer` - for making any body of text look good when squished
